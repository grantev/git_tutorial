Introduction
------------

Git is a general-purpose version control system
that gives you a lot of power for managing your projects.
Git allows you to

1. Track the history of your project's development through time
2. Identify changes that occurred between revisions
3. Safely make changes to your project without losing your original work
4. Temporarily go back to a previous version without losing the original
5. Back-up and share your project with others

Perhaps you won't need to do many of these things on very small projects,
but they become very useful as your software grows.

Note that Git works best with plain text files,
e.g., source code, HTML files, or a LaTeX manuscript.
It is not as useful with non-plain text files, like images and Word documents.

Identify yourself
-----------------

Before we start using Git, let's identify ourselves to Git so that all our
revisions have an author.  This is especially important in collaborative
projects because we would like to keep track of who edited something.

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Create a project and a file
---------------------------

Now we're ready to use git.  Let's start by creating a directory for our new
project; we'll call this directory "project-[INITIALS]".  For this project,
let's say that we need a program that would calculate the mean of the standard
input; let's create such a program in python.

    import sys

    sum = 0
    n = 0

    for num in sys.stdin:
      sum += float(num)
      n += 1

    print sum / n

And let's test it:

    for n in $(seq 20); do echo $n; done | python mean.py

Initialize git
--------------

We want to be able to keep track of changes to this project, which currently
has just one file.  To do that, we first initialize git to tell it that we're
interested in tracking this project:

    git init

All this did was to create an empty repository, but it won't automatically
track all of the files in the project.

Add file to repo
----------------
    
We must tell git which files we want to track; and we do this with git add:

    git add mean.py

We've just told git that we want to track this file.

Initial commit
--------------

We must also tell git when to save a set of changes that we make (this is
called a "commit").  Because we've added a file to track, we now want to tell
git to save this change.

    git commit -am "Add initial file to project"

It tells you there that you've changed one file, in our case we've addeded it,
and added 10 lines of text.  We can view a history (or log) of our commits with:

    git log

This shows you the commit id (also called revision number), author, date, and
your comment.

Additional commits
------------------

Let's make changes to our program and then commit those. Let's add comments to
our code.

  # Sum input values

At this point, the file we've changed and the file that's in the repository are
different.  We can check what those differences are with:

    git diff

You can see right here that these are the lines we've added (they have plus
signs in front of them); these lines without the plus signs are the same
between the files, but are there to show you where the changes are.  We can get
prettier output by telling git we want things in color:

    git config --global color.diff auto
    git diff

Now changes are easier to see.  We can get a less detailed report of what files
we've changed with:

    git status

This line tells us that we've modified mean.py
Let's now commit the new changes:

    git commit -am "Add a comment"
      
Now status shows nothing:

    git status
    git diff

And we have a new entry in our history or log:

    git log

View changes between revisions
------------------------------

If we want to know what changed between two different commits,
we can use git diff with the two revision numbers:

    git diff [commit_id1] [commit_id2]

We don't even have to paste the entire number,
just enough for them to be unique.

Make parallel changes
---------------------

Let's say we want to extend the functionality of our python program
to calculate the mean of numbers in a file.
We could edit mean.py as we've done and commit the changes,
but say we're not exactly sure what needs to be changed.
We don't want to screw around with our original mean.py because it works.
The solution is to create a new branch of work,
where we make changes and track their history
without even touching our original mean.py.

Our current work is on a branch called master (by default),
as git status tells us:

    git status

This is our main branch of work.
Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b handle_file

A new branch has been created. We can list our branches with:

    git branch

Here you see our new branch and the master branch;
the new branch has a star next to it because we're on it.

Let's make some changes to mean.py:

    # Print the mean of the numbers given in a file

    import sys

    sum = 0
    n = 0

    for num in open('data.txt'):
      sum += float(num)
      n += 1

    print sum / n

Add a data.txt file with numbers in it, and test the program.  It seems to
work, so let's commit those changes now by using a shorthand to both stage and
commit those files git is tracking:

    git commit -am 'Changed to handle numbers in a file."

And let's look at our new log:

    git log

Notice that the commits we made in the main branch are there, that's because
it's a branch, not an independent project. When we're happy about the changes
we've made, we can integrate (or merge) those changes with the main branch.  We
must first switch to our master branch, and notice that mean.py is now how it
used to be:

    git checkout master
    cat mean.py

Also notice that the data.txt file is there, even though we added it in the
handle_file branch; this is because we never told git to track this file, so
git doesn't do anything with it.  Now we merge the changes into master from the
handle_file branch:

    git merge handle_file

Let's verify that mean.py contains the changes we made in the handle_file
branch, and then we can just delete that branch:

    git branch -d handle_file

Merge conflicts
---------------

Merging can become a little more complicated when you make parallel changes on
the same line in different branches (either by you or your collaborator).

For example, let's make a new branch and change a line (we'll do it in a single
step this time):

    git checkout -b new_change

    ...
    file_name = 'data.txt'
    for num in open(file_name):
    ...

Test it, and then commit those changes:

    git commit -am "Created file_name variable."

Let's switch back to our master branch, and make changes to a line we changed
in our other branch (change the data file name).

    git checkout master

    ...
    for num in open('data_2.txt'):
    ...

Test it, and commit it:

    git commit -am "Changed the data file name."

Now let's merge the changes we made in our new_change branch into our master
branch:

    git merge new_change

And it fails. Git can't easily merge the changes because we changed some of the
same lines differently.  We must resolve the conflict manually, but git helps
us by telling us where the conflicts are in each file.  Just open the file
mean.py; the stuff in between `<<<<<<<< HEAD` and `==========` is in the master
branch, and the stuff between `============` and `>>>>>>>>>>>> new_change` is
in the new_change branch.  Let's manually merge these changes:

    ...
    file_name = 'data_2.txt'
    for num in open(file_name):
    ...

To mark the file as resolved, we simply say:

    git add mean.py

And then we commit the merge and edit the message:

    git commit

Now let's look at our log to confirm that the merge is in our history:

    git log

As you can see, the latest log tells you what was merged, and includes the
history of the changes made in the other branch.  Finally, let's delete the old
branch:

    git branch -d new_change

Using branches
--------------

So the way you want to use branches is like this:

1. You have a change to make, but you don't want to mess up the main branch
2. You make a branch and work on that change (committing to it)
3. If you like the results, merge the new changes back into master

This way your master branch can be clean of possible changes that may end up
being thrown away if those changes are not necessary or don't work.

GitHub
------

Git allows you to control your project's history on your computer, but you can
also allow others to contribute to the same project, or you might want to work
on the same project from a different computer.  GitHub is a place where you can
host your projects online, so that it can be accessible to anyone you allow.
The concept is similar to Google Docs, where your documents are online so that
anyone you allow can access them and edit them.

Hopefully, you've all created a GitHub account.

Let's go to the github website: github.com.  Please log in to your account.
Let's create a new repository where we'll store our created project.  Name it
the same as the project directory you created, and give it a short description:

    Repository name: project-[INITIALS]
    Description:     Sample project

We have to make the project public with a free account; that's it! We're ready
to copy our files to our new repository. Just follow the steps given to you.
Let's go back to the command-line, add a remote location for our repository:

    git remote add origin git@github.com:redcurry/project-[INITIALS].git

and push the files into the remote repository:

    git push origin master

Don't worry what origin and master are at the moment; we'll revisit those
later.  Now we can check our repository online and see the files that we've
added to it, along with all of the history of the project.

Pair up with another person. You are going to make changes to each other's
project. This will show you how easy it is to collaborate among people.  First,
give each other the address of your repository (use the HTTP protocol). This
information is on your GitHub repository home page.

Go up one directory, and then copy of this repository into your computer.

    git clone https://github.com/redcurry/project-[INITIALS].git

Go into this new project directory.  Notice you not only have the project
file(s) but also its history:

    git log

Edit mean.py in some way (perhaps change a variable name). Then add the file
and commit (with a meaningful message):

  git add mean.py
  git commit -m "Edited the program."

Check the log and notice your new commit entry. Now push your changes to
GitHub:

  git push

Go back to your original project. Get (or pull) the changes made by your group
partner, and check to see that they are there:

  git pull
  git log

Notice the author names in the commits. They should be different.
